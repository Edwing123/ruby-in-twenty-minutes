# Interactive Ruby

Ruby comes with a set of tools that ease the process of developing
and learning with Ruby, one of such tools is **Interactive Ruby**.

It's a program that let's you feed it Ruby statements, which are later processed
and executed, and which result (of the statements) gets shown to the screen.

In Linux, which is the OS operating system I am using, the program is called `irb`.
